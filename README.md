# master-thesis
This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the results from my Master's thesis. The implementation of Particle Marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) includes precomputed results stored in .rds files, allowing you to load them directly instead of re-running the simulations.

The PMMH code is built on my R package [bayesSSM](https://bjarkehautop.github.io/bayesSSM/), which I developed during this thesis.
