# master-thesis  
This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the results from my Master's thesis. The implementations of any example or analysis using Particle Marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) include precomputed results stored in `.rds` files, allowing you to load them directly instead of re-running the simulations.  

The PMMH code is built on my R package [bayesSSM](https://bjarkehautop.github.io/bayesSSM/), which I developed during this thesis.
